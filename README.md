ATtiny10 Projects and Libraries Init

Well, I'm really pissed.  Just as I break down and start programming the ATtiny10's I've had on the shelf for 2 years, Microchip, Atmel's
new task-master, decides to end-of-life the chip.  Screw you Microchip!

Regardless, I ordered 200 before they went out.  It's a nice little SOT-23-6 chip 8-bit AVR microcontroller.  They are good for dropping into projects which require some flip-flop, ADC, or PWM, given the discrete componenets required for these would probably outreach the cost of a signle ATtiny10.

Anyway, this project set includes projects and libraries dealing with the ATtiny10.

...damn you Microchip....

*Update*: Apparently, [Microchip has not EOL'ed the SOTs?](https://github.com/Ladvien/ATtiny10-Projects-and-Libraries/issues/1)  Thanks for the information [dpiegdon](https://github.com/dpiegdon)
